Hold right click and WASD for movement. E for upwards Q for downwards.

- Red points are 𝑃 = {𝑃1, … , 𝑃𝑖, … , 𝑃𝑛}
- Blue points are 𝑄 = {𝑄1, … ,𝑄𝑖, … ,𝑄𝑚}
- Green points are the point cloud achieved after calculated transformation applied.

  In project files;
    - File1.txt contains points P
    - File2.txt contains points Q
    - File3.txt contains point cloud after Rigid Transformation applied
    - File4.txt contains point cloud after Rigid transformation up to a global scale applied
